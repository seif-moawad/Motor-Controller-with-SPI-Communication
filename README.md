ntroduction

Welcome to the Motor Controller with SPI Communication project! This embedded system project utilizes two microcontrollers to control a motor using the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol. By establishing communication between a master and a slave microcontroller, this system enables speed control of the motor based on user inputs.
Components

    Microcontrollers:
        Master Microcontroller: Responsible for sending control signals to the slave microcontroller and receiving feedback.
        Slave Microcontroller: Receives control signals from the master microcontroller and adjusts the motor speed accordingly.

    Motor:
        The motor being controlled by the microcontrollers. The speed of the motor can be adjusted based on user inputs.

    SPI Communication:
        The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol is used for communication between the master and slave microcontrollers. It allows for the exchange of control signals and feedback information.

Functionalities

    Speed Control:
        The system allows the user to control the speed of the motor.
        The master microcontroller sends speed control signals to the slave microcontroller via SPI communication.
        The slave microcontroller adjusts the motor speed based on the received control signals.

    User Input:
        User inputs are used to change the motor speed.
        The system detects user inputs, such as button presses, to increase or decrease the motor speed.

    SPI Communication:
        SPI communication is established between the master and slave microcontrollers.
        The master microcontroller sends control signals to the slave microcontroller.
        The slave microcontroller receives the control signals and adjusts the motor speed accordingly.
        Feedback information may be sent back from the slave to the master microcontroller to provide status or confirmation.

Conclusion

The Motor Controller with SPI Communication project showcases the implementation of an embedded system for controlling a motor using two microcontrollers connected through the SPI protocol. By utilizing SPI communication, the master microcontroller can send speed control signals to the slave microcontroller, which adjusts the motor speed accordingly. This project provides a foundation for motor control applications and demonstrates the practical use of SPI communication in embedded systems.
